                <h1>The History of Belgium Campus</h1>
                <p>The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union <br> 
                    and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc, that started in 1947, two years after <br> 
                    the end of World War II, and lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
                    The term cold war is <br> used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each <br> 
                    supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts, known as proxy wars.               
                    The Cold War was <br> based on an ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, <br> 
                    following their roles as the Allies of World War II that led to victory against Nazi Germany and <br> 
                    Imperial Japan in 1945. Aside from the nuclear arms race and conventional military deployment, <br> 
                    the struggle for dominance was expressed indirectly, such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, <br> 
                    espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, and technological competitions like the Space Race. <br> 
                    The Cold War began with the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947, started a gradual winding down <br> 
                    with the Sino-Soviet split between the Soviets and the People's Republic of China in 1961, and ended with <br> 
                    the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
